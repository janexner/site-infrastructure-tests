# Site Infrastructure Tests

This project contains code that you can use to build your own test suite.

The suite can be used to test parts of the site infrastructure that are important for whatever your Analytics/Marketing team ads on top of it using the tag management system.

Running this suite as a regression tests effectively prevents dev from pulling the ground from under analytics feet.

## How it works

The Site Infrastructure Tests framework is based on cucumber/gherkin. Check https://docs.cucumber.io/guides/10-minute-tutorial/#write-a-scenario for a quick introduction.

Tests, called "features" in cucumber/gherkin, describe how we expect the site to react to loading a page or actions happening on the page.

In order to use the framework on your site, you provide features.

You can (and probably *must*) specify the location of your chromedriver executable using the `webdriver.chrome.driver` property! If you're on Linux/Mac, the tool will look for chromedriver in `/usr/local/bin/`, and on Windows it'll look in `c:\bin\`. If your chromedriver is anywhere else, you *must* tell the tool!
See https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/getting-started for hints.

## "Drivers"

While I originally used phantomJS, I changed to HTMLUnit at some point, and now to ChromeDriver. I presume you know how to checkout by Release, so suffice it to say that 1.0 uses phantomJS, 2.0 is HTMLUnit and 3.x uses ChromeDriver.

The block tracking feature of 2.0 is gone in 3.x, but might come back if I find out how to do it.

Note that there is a blog article for version 2.0: https://webanalyticsfordevelopers.com/2017/07/18/automated-testing-blocking-tracking/

For v4, I made a big step, awau from TDD and towards BDD. The test description using "features" is way ahead of my original JSON file, and it makes the whole framework a lot easier and simpler.

## Features

While gherkin describes the formal language used in features, the semantics of the statements still has to be coded. The following list shows all statements / tests that are currently available.

Here is an example of a feature file:

```gherkin
@analytics
Feature: Minimal tracking infrastructure on the home page is ok
  As an analytics team
  I want the home page to contain tracking infrastructure
  so I can track data and analyse it

  @trackingdata
  Scenario: The home page loads and all data is present
    Given the page "https://www.jan-exner.de/" is loaded
    And we wait for 1 second
    Then there is a data layer element called "digitalData.page.pageInfo.language"
    And the "digitalData.page.pageInfo.pageName" data layer element is "Home"

  @trackingtools
  Scenario: The home page loads and contains DTM
    Given the page "https://www.jan-exner.de/" is loaded
    Then DTM is present
    And the DTM library is "satelliteLib-f898bce177301e894492bf685fe6bc28e8eca6c5"
```

This example contains 1 feature called "Minimal tracking infrastructure on the home page is ok", as well as 2 scenarios.

Each scenario is describes with "Given", "When" (optional), and "Then" phrases. "And" phrases do exactly what you'd think they'd do.

The "The home page loads and contains DTM" scenario first loads the page on "https://www.jan-exner.de/", then runs two checks: "DTM is present" and "the DTM library is ...".

The feature passes the test if all "Then" statements in all scenarios are successful.

## Available Statements

When you write features, you can use the following statements.

### Setup / "Given" / "When"

These statements can be used to setup for the tests in the scenarios. You must use at least `the page "<URL>" is loaded`.

#### `the page "<URL>" is loaded`

Causes the framework to load the page behind that URL in Chrome.

Example: `the page "https://www.jan-exner.de/" is loaded`

#### `the snippet "<JS code>" is executed`

Causes the framework to execute the Javascript code inside Chrome.

Example: `the snippet "window.jan=true;" is executed`

#### `we wait for xy second[s]`

Causes the framework to wait a number of seconds before working any further.

Example: `we wait for 1 second`

Example: `we wait for 5 seconds`

### Tests / "Then"

Statements that are not related to any specific tools.

#### `there is a data layer element called "<name>"`

Causes the framework to test whether there is a data layer element with the name given.

Example: `there is a data layer element called "digitalData.page.pageInfo.pageName"`

#### `the "<name>" data layer element is "<value>"`

Causes the framework to compare the value of the data element with the value given.

Example: `the "digitalData.page.pageInfo.pageName" data layer element is "Home"`

#### `the "<name>" data layer element is <value>`

Causes the framework to compare the value of the data element with the value given. Same  as above but for numeric values.

Example: `the "digitalData.page.pageInfo.ageInDays" data layer element is 5`

#### `the DOM element "<name>" exists`

Causes the framework to test whether the DOM element of the given name/path exists.

Example: `the DOM element "button.cartAdd" exists`

#### `the DOM element "<name>" exists <n> times`

Causes the framework to test whether the DOM element of the given name/path exists n times.

Example: `the DOM element "button.cartAdd" exists 2 times`

#### `the snippet "<JS snippet>" returns true`

Causes the framework to execute the Javascript snippet given and check whether it evaluates to true.

Example: `the snippet "return window.jan" returns true`
