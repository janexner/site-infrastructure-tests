@analytics
Feature: Tracking infrastructure on the about page is ok
  As an analytics team
  I want the about page to contain tracking infrastructure
  so I can track data and analyse it

  @trackingdata
  Scenario: The about page loads and all data is present
    Given the page "https://www.jan-exner.de/about/" is loaded
    And the "digitalData.page.pageInfo.language" data layer element is "en-GB"
    And the "digitalData.page.pageInfo.pageName" data layer element is "About me"
    And the DOM element "a.amzWishlist" exists
    And the DOM element "a.amzWishlist" exists 2 times

  @trackingtools
  Scenario: The about page loads with all necessary tools
    Given the page "https://www.jan-exner.de/about/" is loaded
    Then jQuery is present
    And the jQuery version is "2.0" or later
    And the jQuery version is below "3"
		And Launch is present
		And the Launch property is called "jan-exner.de"
